These are some basic (and advanced) coding challenges

Here's the basic workflow:

```bash
[~]         $ git clone https://github.com/kolodny/exercises
[~]         $ cd exercises
[exercises] $ npm install
[exercises] $ cd debounce
[debounce]  $ vi index.js
[debounce]  $ npm test
```
This uses a basic TDD approach so take a look at the test.js file in each directory to see what needs to be implemented, write an index.js as the solution file

### Contributing

Pull requests welcome, please follow the basic workflow:

1. Make a folder
2. Copy a package.json from a sibling folder
3. Make a test.js file
4. Optionally provide a README.md
